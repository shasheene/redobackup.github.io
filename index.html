<h2>Why Not Use...?</h2>
<p>Many excellent solutions such as Acronis and Norton Ghost already exist. However, most backup tools cost money, only save data files (rather than the whole system), or come with restrictive licenses. Many are applications that are designed to run on a specific platform. While there are some open source alternatives, these programs are often far too complex for regular users, and most require knowledge of a command line, or ask too many difficult questions.</p>
<p>Everyday computer users, more than any other group, need an intuitive point-and-click solution that can recover them from a disaster, and <strong>Redo&nbsp;Backup and Recovery</strong> was designed for this very purpose. It is the simplest open source backup and recovery solution available.</p>
<h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
<p>Most backup and restore programs require your system to be up and running in order to restore. But what if you cannot boot into Windows? What if you have a nasty virus, and you can't even open Windows to try to restore it back to how it was?</p>
<p>Redo doesn't need Windows. Download and write the ISO to a USB stick, and reboot your machine. The system will load a complete mini operating system with a point-and-click user interface into your computer's memory, without writing any information to your hard drive. Then you will be able to perform backup, restore and recovery actions&mdash;guaranteed&mdash;even if you aren't able to boot into your regular operating system.</p>
<p><strong>Redo Backup and Recovery</strong> is a GPLv3 Perl script built with a GTK2+ interface designed in Glade. It is simply a front end to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://partclone.org/">partclone</a>, which performs the actual backup and restore. The live USB is built on Ubuntu to provide a graphical user interface and unmodified binaries of each program, but the script will run on any Linux platform that has the required programs installed. The Perl source code for the backup script is contained on the live USB&nbsp;itself. And anyone running Ubuntu can build their own live USB from scratch by following our <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/redobackup/redobackup/blob/master/docs/build_instructions/BUILD.ISO.IMAGE.md">simple recipe</a>.</p>
